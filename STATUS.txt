We are applying for the the Reusable badge: we believe that the project is sufficiently documented and actually intend on reusing it in the future to implement extensions of the proposed bidirectional algorithm. We are also applying for the Available badge, given that the implementation is openly available in GitHub and will also be archived in Zenodo after the artifact evaluation comments are taken into account.
